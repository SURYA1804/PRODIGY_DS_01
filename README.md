Data Visualization

This task involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in a dataset.

Categorical vs. Continuous Variables

    1.Categorical variables are those that can be classified into distinct categories.

    2.For instance, gender (male, female, non-binary) or blood type (A, B, AB, O) are categorical variables.
    Continuous variables, on the other hand, can take on any value within a specific range. Examples include height, weight, or temperature.

Bar charts  are suitable for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables. They use bars to represent the frequency or percentage of each category.

Histograms are appropriate for visualizing the distribution of continuous variables. They use bins to group data points into ranges. The height of each bar in the histogram represents the number of data points that fall within the corresponding bin.

Sample Dataset

    The task instructs us to use the World Bank dataset on population (https://data.worldbank.org/). This dataset likely contains a column named "SP.POP.TOTL" which represents the total population for a set of countries over time. This is a continuous variable.

Steps to Complete the Task

    1.Import Libraries: You'll need to import libraries like pandas (for data manipulation) and matplotlib (for creating visualizations) in Python.
    2.Load the Dataset: Use pandas functions like pd.read_csv() to load the World Bank data from the CSV file.
    3.Prepare the Data: You may need to clean or preprocess the data before visualization. This might involve handling missing values or converting data types.
    4.Create the Visualization: Choose between a bar chart or histogram based on whether the variable is categorical or continuous. Use matplotlib functions like bar() or hist() to create the visualization.
    5.Customize the Plot: Add labels, titles, and customize the appearance of the chart for better readability.

Expected Output

    The expected output is a bar chart or histogram that effectively visualizes the distribution of the chosen variable in the World Bank dataset. The chart should be clear, informative, and include labels and titles.
